Hi! I'm **Enze Tao**, a PhD student in Computer Science at the Australian National University, supervised by [Dr Dylan Campbell](https://sites.google.com/view/djcampbell). I previously completed my Master's in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at ANU, and my Bachelor's in Internet of Things Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University.
